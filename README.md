# NeuralNetwork

### Currently understanding Neural Network from Scratch with Python

Haven't used any Libraries, just pure python. Will work on Bigger Dataset. 
The Dataset is basically an example Dataset



###### How it works (NEURAL NETWORK BASICS)
Data [ Length , Width , Target ] Target can either be "0" which is Blue Flower or "1" which is Red Flower
- First Model includes a basic example where I've taken random weights and tried predicting the output
- In the Second Model, I've applied a forloop which changes the weights and bias. Using these weights predicts the output

##### NEURAL NETWORK ADVANCE
- In the Basic Section , I've revised the concept of weights and bias. And Using Different small Data in `2D` OR `1D` Array
- Learn and build Activation Functions ( ReLU, Softmax )
- Implementing LOSS FUNCTIONS ON 2 Cases: Where the TARGET is ONEHOTCODED ( 2D ARRAY ) or 1D Array
- Learning about Slope ( Y = MX+C ) and how it effects the learning of the neural network.
- Changing weights to calculate the loss function.
