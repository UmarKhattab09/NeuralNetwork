# NeuralNetwork

### Currently understanding Neural Network from Scratch with Python

Haven't used any Libraries, just pure python. Will work on Bigger Dataset. 
The Dataset is basically an example Dataset

Data [ Length , Width , Target ] Target can either be "0" which is Blue Flower or "1" which is Red Flower

###### How it works 
- First Model includes a basic example where I've taken random weights and tried predicting the output

- In the Second Model, I've applied a forloop which changes the weights and bias. Using these weights predicts the output
